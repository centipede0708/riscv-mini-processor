# riscv-mini-processor
5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor in Verilog supporting basic arithmetic, logic, and branching instructions. Designed key components like instruction fetch, decode, ALU, register file, and memory interface. Verified pipeline behavior through waveform simulation and modular testbenches.
